# Smule desktop

HEAVY WIP --- HOBBY PROJECT (DO NOT EXPECT MAINTAINANCE)

## Motivation

<p>
> be me <br/>
> enjoy karaoke app on phone <br/>
> i want bigger screen <br/>
> smule doesnt support desktop <br/>
> try emulator <br/>
> emulator has UNBEARABLE microphone latency <br/>
> decide to build my own
</p>

on a real note, this is partially just an opportunity for me to learn `electron` + `vite` + `react` + `tailwindcss` in one go, as i'll eventually begin writing more and more (cross-(desktop)-platform) programs every now and again
