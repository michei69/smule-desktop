# Smule desktop

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

HEAVY WIP --- HOBBY PROJECT

## Motivation

<p>
> be me <br/>
> enjoy karaoke app on phone <br/>
> i want bigger screen <br/>
> smule doesnt support desktop <br/>
> try emulator <br/>
> emulator has UNBEARABLE microphone latency <br/>
> decide to build my own
</p>

on a real note, this is partially just an opportunity for me to learn `electron` + `vite` + `react` + `tailwindcss` in one go, as i'll eventually begin writing more and more (cross-(desktop)-platform) programs every now and again

###### P.S. i will continue refusing to call songs as "arrangements" not because i don't want to be compliant with their internal naming, but because i hate that word :3
