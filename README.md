# Smule desktop

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

HEAVY WIP --- HOBBY PROJECT

check out the underlying project which this entire app is based on: [smule-api](https://github.com/michei69/smule-api)

## Motivation

<p>
> be me <br/>
> enjoy karaoke app on phone <br/>
> i want bigger screen <br/>
> smule doesnt support desktop <br/>
> try emulator <br/>
> emulator has UNBEARABLE microphone latency <br/>
> decide to build my own
</p>

on a real note, this is partially just an opportunity for me to learn `electron` + `vite` + `react` + `tailwindcss` in one go, as i'll eventually begin writing more and more (cross-(desktop)-platform) programs every now and again

###### P.S. i really dont feel like properly maintaining this project (hence the badge). The smule-api project, on another hand, will get somewhat regular updates, whenever i'm free. It's a pretty ambitious project, as there's a lot of stuff to cover, but it's fun to work on, so that's what gets me going :3
